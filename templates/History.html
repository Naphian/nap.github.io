    <h2 style="background-color:lightgreen;text-align: center; font-size: 30px">Intro</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, and welcome. Allow me to introduce
      myself - I am Kaleab E. Alamnew. My life&apos;s journey began
      on the 17th of July 1998, when I took my first breath
      in the bustling metropolis of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
      My formative years unfurled in the picturesque village
      of Mekanisa, a hidden gem that holds an irreplaceable
      corner in my heart. Here, I resided in a secluded,
      three-story haven, void of immediate neighbors, which
      offered me the sanctity of solitude.</p>
    <p>Picture a young boy, navigating through life on a bicycle,
      each pedal stroke propelling him not just down the road but
      also further into his own thoughts, dreams, and aspirations.
      The relative quietude of Mekanisa&apos;s lanes was the ideal
      backdrop against which my imagination came alive. I
      experienced a unique kind of freedom, as expansive as the
      skies above and as intimate as the tales I would one day share.
      Let me quote Paulo Coelho here: "Freedom is not the absence
      of commitments, but the ability to choose &mdash; and commit myself
      to &mdash; what is best for me." Mekanisa gave me that invaluable
      freedom to choose, to dream, and to become.</p>
    <p>Life presented me with a new chapter when I moved to a
      sprawling condominium complex situated in the heart of the city,
      near the iconic Semen Hotel and closely monitored by three
      police stations. Imagine transitioning from a serene village
      to an animated microcosm of hundreds of families. It was a
      breathtaking contrast. Day in and day out, the condominium was
      a lively tapestry of social engagements, communal laughter, and
      unforgettable shared experiences. The essence of community was
      no longer a concept but a vivid, palpable reality. I was
      surrounded by neighbors who would eventually become more than
      just familiar faces&mdash;they became my extended family.</p>
    <p>It&apos;s crucial to mention my educational milestones, as they
      form the cornerstone of my intellectual and emotional growth.
      My school years began in Betelhem, setting the academic
      foundation before I shifted to Jiva High School in 2013.
      This school wasn&apos;t merely a place of learning; it was a second
      home. I succeeded academically, certainly, but Jiva gave me
      more than grades. It bestowed upon me friendships that I
      treasure, memories that I hold dear, and life lessons that
      have shaped my moral compass. Gratitude fills my heart when
      I think of every teacher, every friend, who contributed to
      my transformation. They didn&apos;t just teach me; they believed
      in me, and in doing so, changed the trajectory of my life.</p>
    <p>Then came 2017, a watershed year. Fresh off the high of
      achieving stellar grades in Ethiopia&apos;s Matriculation exams,
      I transplanted my dreams and ambitions to the fertile grounds
      of the United States. With each passing semester, from an
      anonymous college to the hallowed halls of UCLA, my character
      was forged through rigorous academics and soul-enriching
      friendships. The journey, I must confess, was both challenging
      and exhilarating. Yet, every obstacle conquered made the
      triumphs all the more rewarding. As I walked across the
      graduation stage in 2023, I realized that my American dream,
      once a flicker of possibility, had been brilliantly realized.</p>
    <p>Today, I revel in the life that I&apos;ve created here in the USA.
      I stand here, as a living testament to the power of dreams and
      the indomitable will that turns them into reality. Like the
      iconic Maya Angelou said, "I can be changed by what happens
      to me. But I refuse to be reduced by it." My journey, filled
      with its ups and downs, has not reduced me; instead, it has
      enriched me in ways too profound to articulate.</p>
    <p>So, why do I share my story? I share it as a canvas upon
      which you can project your own aspirations and challenges,
      a tale of relentless ambition, and unyielding resilience.
      It is a reminder that each of us is the author of our destiny.
      In the narrative of my life, you might find the inspiration
      to be the hero of your own.</p>
    <p>Thank you for allowing me to share this voyage with you.
      Until the next chapter.</p>
